# 👋 Hi there! 

I'm new to GitHub and learning to build useful tools with Python. My main interests are in **automation**, **network utilities**, and **command-line tools**.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

- Network scanners (like port scanning, ping sweep)
- File automation and backup scripts
- Command-line based Python tools
- Simple scripts for everyday tasks

## 🧰 Technologies I Use

- 🐍 Python (main language)
- 🔌 Libraries: `socket`, `subprocess`, `requests`
- 🖥️ Terminal scripting (CLI tools)
- 🌐 Basics of networking and protocols


- **[Youtube Education Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@JustSHorTT)**  
  This Channel is for Learning About Computers, Networks, etc.



## 🎯 Goals

- Improve my Python and networking skills  
- Build practical tools for system and network tasks  
- Contribute to open source projects as I learn



🧪 I'm in the learning phase, but planning to share more projects soon. Feel free to ⭐️ star a repo if you find it interesting!
